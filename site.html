        <h2>What is Basketball?</h2>
  
        <p>Basketball is a sport that was invented in the United States. It is played between two games of five people on a rectangular court. Each team tries to score on the
        other team's hoop, which is usually elevated 10 feet off the ground. Basketball is a team sport. The half-court line divides the court into two sections, and the ball is moved
        through dribbling and passing. Usually, when either team scores a basket, they will earn either two points, or three points if it was shot from on or outside the three-point arc.
        Since not much equipment is required to play basketball, it has grown in popularity since 1891, when it was invented by James Naismith, an instructor in physical education. 
        The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the professional basketball league in North America.</p>
