           <p>Basketball is a dynamic sport that builds stamina from the short sprints required from running up and down the court. Jumping to score a shot, take a lay-up, or  
           grab a rebound help build musuclar endurance. Basketball is also good for mental health, as it requires hard work, dedication, and self-discipline. Not only will basketball
           help you burn calories, it also helps your bone health.</p>
