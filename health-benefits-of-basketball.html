 <h2>Health Benefits of Basketball</h2>
   
           <p>Basketball is a dynamic sport that builds stamina from the short sprints required from running up and down the court. Jumping to score a shot, take a lay-up, or  
           grab a rebound help build musuclar endurance. Basketball is also good for mental health, as it requires hard work, dedication, and self-discipline. Not only will basketball
           help you burn calories, it also helps your bone health. The constant movement in basketball increases your heart rate, helping decrease the risk of heart disease
           and stroke later on in life. Basketball can also help reduce those stress levels, and yes, stress is usually not healthy. Playing basketball can therefore boost the 
           health of your immune system, which is essential given that the world is in the midst of a pandemic. Lastly, basketball can develop better coordination
           and motor skills.</p>
