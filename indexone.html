  <h4>History of Basketball</h4>
         <p>In the first game of basketball, the goals were two peach baskets. From 1895-1897, the rules of basketball were revised to specify five-player teams, and 
         scoring guidelines. Basketball began to be played in other countries in the late 1800's, such as England, Australia, and Japan. In 1903, it was ruled that all
         boundary lines must be straight in a basketball court, and soon after, glass backbaords were legalized.</p>
