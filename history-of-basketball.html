  <h2>History of Basketball</h2>
         <p>In the first game of basketball, the goals were two peach baskets. From 1895-1897, the rules of basketball were revised to specify five-player teams, and 
         scoring guidelines. Basketball began to be played in other countries in the late 1800's, such as England, Australia, and Japan. Basketball was introduced to the world 
         through efforts from the US Army and YMCA. Futhermore, it was also in this time period that championships were created and most colleges established their own 
         teams. In 1903, it was ruled that all boundary lines must be straight in a basketball court, and soon after, glass backbaords were legalized. In 1936, basketball was officially
         made an Olympic sport. Coaching was actually prohibited until 1949! The sport of basketball has come a long way since its initial creation, in which it was played with a soccer ball. </p>
