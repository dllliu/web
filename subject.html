        <h2>What is Basketball?</h2>
        <p>Basketball is a sport that was invented in the United States. It is played between two games of five people on a rectangular court. Each team tries to score on the
        other team's hoop, which is usually elevated 10 feet off the ground. Since not much equipment is required to play basketball, it has grown in popularity since 1891, when it 
        was invented by James Naismith, an instructor in physical education. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the professional basketball league in North America.</p>

         <h4>History of Basketball</h4>
         <p>In the first game of basketball, the goals were two peach baskets. From 1895-1897, the rules of basketball were revised to specify five-player teams, and 
         scoring guidelines. Basketball began to be played in other countries in the late 1800's, such as England, Australia, and Japan. In 1903, it was ruled that all
         boundary lines must be straight in a basketball court, and soon after, glass backbaords were legalized.</p>

          <h4>Health Benefits of Basketball</h4>
           <p>Basketball is a dynamic sport that builds stamina from the short sprints required from running up and down the court. Jumping to score a shot, take a lay-up, or  
           grab a rebound help build musuclar endurance. Basketball is also good for mental health, as it requires hard work, dedication, and self-discipline. Not only will basketball
           help you burn calories, it also helps your bone health.</p>
